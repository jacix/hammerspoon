# hammerspoon
Jason's public hammerspoon scripts
* init.lua - the initializer.  For now it's everything, but as I add more, I'll split things out. Contains:
  * demos from the HS intro. All are cmd-alt-ctrl: R=reload; W=notify; Q=alert; C=spoon clock
  * cmd-alt-ctrl-T = take a URL from the pasteboard and create a prettified hyperlink in Teams
